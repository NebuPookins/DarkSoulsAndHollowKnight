# Hollow Knight is similar to Dark Souls, and likely took inspiration from it.

The thesis of this document is that "Hollow Knight is similar to Dark Souls,
and likely took inspiration from it." This is not a criticism of Hollow Knight.
It is very common for games to take inspiration from other games, and it is
healthy for the game development community to iterate on, explore, and refine
genre tropes.

That said, I've noticed some people claim they see no similarities between the
two games. When they ask for examples of similarities, it can be difficult to
satisfy their request, because there are so many similarities between the two
games that it is difficult to know where to start. This document can act as a
catalogue of similarities between the two games for easy reference.

## Preface 1: Were the creators of Hollow Knight aware of Dark Souls?

A common phenomenon in the arts and science is for the same ideas to be
independently discovered by different people. For example, calculus was
independently invented by Leibniz and Newton. In story telling, sometimes the
zeitgeist of society pushes independent authors to come up with similar
narratives. A priori, it's possible that Team Cherry, the creators of HK,
independently developed HK without being aware of DS's existence. If this is
what happened, then it would be incorrect to say that HK was inspired by DS.

Empirically, however, this was not the case. In an interview, the developers of
Team Cherry mentioned that they had played DS before the development of HK, and
specifically found mechanics in DS that they found interesting and that they
consciously decided to add to HK.

> **Interviewer 1:** We've heard a ton of people, including all of us, mention: Did Dark Souls play any inspiration in the development or design of the game at all?
>
> **Team Cherry 1:** I played some of the first one, and got to that one fat guy. [...] I've played Dark Souls 3 as well.
>
> **Team Cherry 2:** I've played all of them, I should say, and liked them a lot; and I was one of those people -- and I'm sure a lot of you guys are the same -- played Demon Souls at that time when we were importing it from Hong Kong or wherever it was from [...] and it was this strange unknown game, and it was a game where you didn't know the edge of it and the boundaries of the system, and at the time that was refreshing. And I think a lot of people say Hollow Knight has that souls quality, and I think that's fair enough. But also, the souls games have those qualities from the older games. And it's much easier --I mentioned it on another podcast we did-- where it's almost like a [vodhead???] issue where you have a new generation of people who haven't played the earlier games like Zelda 2 [...] and it's much easier to say it's like Darksouls [...] as a modern game that emphasizes all the qualities.

[...]

> **Interviewer 2:** I agree with that analysis. It's very interesting too, because I think we were all fairly convinced there was a lot of souls inspiration, and it could very well be due to like you said, we all just draw from that modern comparison quite a bit.
>
> **Team Cherry 2:** There is one explicit one which, I'm hesitant to mention it, but I will mention it, but the souls system is, a large element of that, is the bloodborn health regain system, which is when you hit an enemy in bloodborn, you gain a bit of health [...] there's a parallel there with our soul system.
>
> **Interviewer 3:** The only two parts only strikes me as souls-y is the way the world fits together, but I can see that that's like convergent evolution from other games that came earlier, but also the corpse mechanic of getting back to where your dead body is to get some currency back.
>
> **Team Cherry 1:** Yeah, that's the other thing with that. 'Cause I remember thinking that idea was pretty interested in Dark souls.

## Preface 2: DS and HK vs NES-Era Games

There are many ways in which DS and HK are similar, but many of those
similarities are uninteresting, because the commonalities they share might be
shared by all video games such as having a health system, or having levels that
involve platforming. Thus, we are primarily concerned with similarities between
DS and HK but which are otherwise absent or rare in other videogames.

In particular, some people have claimed that DS was not inspired by HK, but just
by "NES era gaming", and in particular the Zelda series from the NES era. Indeed,
Team Cherry have made claims similar to this (see the quoted interview in the
previous section). As such, when this document lists a similarity between DS and
HK, it will also provide some remarks on how common that element appears in NES
era games, and Zelda in particular.

## Mechanical Similarities

| Concept | In Dark Souls | In Hollow Knight | In NES Era Games (especially Zelda) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| When your character dies, you lose some of your resources and leave behind a corpse. Retracing your steps to reach the corpse allows you to retrieve your lost resources. Dying "twice in a row" without retrieving your corpse causes the earlier corpse and its associated resources to be lost forever. | Corpse retrieval mechanic is implement exactly as describe | HK adds a twist that your corpse (called "Shade") fights back a little bit, but is otherwise very similar. | No known NES game that implements this mechanic. Zelda does not implement this mechanic. |

## Similarities in World Design, Character Design, Lore, Scenes and Set Pieces

| Concept | In Dark Souls | In Hollow Knight | In NES Era Games (especially Zelda) |
|---------|---------------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Lore is generally obtuse. Strong reliance on environmental story telling (inferring what must have happened in an area by observing the non-interactable background decorations). Strong reliable on inferring lore by reading optional text (not via cutscenes that are pushed onto the player). Many players who beat the game will never learn the full lore. Many players who are interested in the lore will need to do external research (e.g. read wikis) and will not have inferred it just from the materials presented by the game. | Implemented exactly as described, with many of the optional text being contained in item descriptions. | Implemented exactly as described, with many of the optional text being on lore tablets, or "dream nail dialogue". | Lore is generally mistaken to be obtuse, but in fact is simply underdeveloped (i.e. there is no deeper lore to uncover). Little to no environmental story telling (arguably, the low fidelity graphics of the NES did not support this method of story telling). The entire lore can often be understood simply by reading the instruction booklet included with the NES cartridge, sometimes combined with any intro text and epilogue text, which "cannot be missed" by a player who completes the game. |
